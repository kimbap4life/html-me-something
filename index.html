            <h2 id="title">WHY KOREAN SPECIAL FORCES SUCK</h2>
            <p>Sadly, it is mandatory for every Korean guy over 18 to serve military service for two years.<br>
                Because of North Korea run by Kim Jong Un, also known as ‘Rocket Man’, I was drafted to the military service at the age of 22.<br>
                One day at the boot camp, I was selected to apply for Special Forces.<br>
                I had no idea how jumping off a plane would feel like but was just fascinated by their black beret – it looked amazing.<br>
                So, I signed the contract in front of Special Forces officers and was super happy that I was accepted to them.<br>
                But soon I realized that joining Special Forces was the biggest mistake I've ever made in my entire life!</p>

                    <h3 class="fontsize">Reason #1: The Unidentified Red Medicine</h3>
                        <p>Being a member of Special Forces means a lot of possible injuries and wounds. So, I had a lot of injuries and wounds while training.<br>
                            Typically, I had an ACL injury once and I couldn’t even walk. But I had to keep walking since the colonel was watching me<br>
                            I found out my whole left leg was bleeding later on so that I met a medic at my unit that night.<br>
                            Surprisingly, the medic did nothing much but applied this red medicine on my leg.<br>
                            After a while, I realized that the red medicine named ‘Povidin’ was used for any types of wounds.<br>
                            Even there was a joke in military that the medic always gives you the Povidin, not a proper prescription, no matter what injuries you have.<br>
                            This was how they treated Special Forces.</p>

                    <h3 class="fontsize">Reason #2: Bullying At Its Finest</h3>
                        <p>It was the first day I was deployed to my unit. I was introduced to many senior soldiers there.<br>
                            One of them just walked up to me and aggressively said, “I don’t like the way you’re standing in front of me.<br>
                            I can make you a disabled person in one second.”<br>
                            Instead of feeling scared to his statement, I felt it was ridiculous and wanted to punch him in his face really.<br>
                            Of course, I had to say I was sorry and then I corrected the way I was standing, knowing what was wrong with it.<br>
                            But it was just beginning. I think I heard all the cursing and physical abuse I can possibly get for the rest of my life at military. How sweet.</p>

                    <h3 class="fontsize">Reason #3: Jumping Out of a Plane For $200</h3>
                        <p>The best part of being Special Forces is to jump off a plane with a parachute. I was trained for three weeks to jump with a parachute.<br>
                            I can tell it was the most physically challenging three weeks in my life because we had to do a lot of physical training along with various landing skills.<br>
                            I still remember the church a day before the jump was super crowded – I guess people were scared to death before jumping.<br>
                            To be honest, jumping out of a plane is something you never get used to – It is scary to death every time you do.<br>
                            I got paid $200 for each jump and talked to myself, “My life is just worth $200? That’s sad and messed up!”</p>
